About the Hash driver
---------------------

Principles
""""""""""

The Hash cryptographic coprocessor provide a hardware implementation of various hash algorithm to support hash signature calculation of various content.
This device is an autonomous device, using a dedicated memory mapping. On STM32F4xx devices, the HASH device support the following hash algorihtms:

   * MD5
   * SHA1
   * SHA224 (with and without HMAC mode)
   * SHA256 (with and without HMAC mode)
